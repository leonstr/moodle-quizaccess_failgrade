# Moodle - Fail Grade Quiz Access Rule (quizaccess_failgrade)

## Description

The purpose of this plugin is to restrict extra attempts on Quiz after the user reach a passing grade.

Based on the [Reattempt Checker - a quiz access rule](https://moodle.org/plugins/quizaccess_reattemptchecker) and [Pass grade quiz access rule](https://moodle.org/plugins/quizaccess_passgrade), the main goal is:
